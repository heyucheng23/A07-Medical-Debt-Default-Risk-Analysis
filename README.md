# A07-Medical-Debt-Default-Risk-Analysis
## Project Description
- This report provides an in-depth analysis of U.S. healthcare debt at the county, state, and national levels from 2011 through 2023, examining key demographic and financial factors influencing healthcare debt. Utilizing multiple data sources, including the Urban Institute Credit Profile Board, the American Hospital Association's Annual Survey database, the CMS Provider File, and the American Community Survey, this study evaluates the impact of hospital market concentration, hospital closures and mergers, the uninsured population, the percentage of adults with disabilities, and average household income on medical debt. Key recommendations include expanding health insurance coverage, providing financial support for low-income households, promoting healthcare market competition to control service costs, and harmonizing regional policies to address disparities and improve equity in healthcare access.
